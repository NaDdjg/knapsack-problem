# knapsack-problem

A web application to visualize and solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using dynamic programming. This project enables users to input a set of items with weights and values, specify a knapsack capacity, and determine the optimal selection of items that maximizes the total value. The app also displays the final state of the dynamic programming table and provides details about the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

## Features
  1. Dynamic Programming Implementation: Solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem with an efficient algorithm.
  2. Complexity Analysis: Displays the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
  3. Matrix Visualization: Shows the final state of the DP matrix, helping users understand how the solution was computed.

## Steps to run
